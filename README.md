Three part script to quickly set up workspace without GUI.

## About
All the code is from the Microsoft Docs, I only combined it so it's easier to use. 

## Hint
Be sure to safeguard your SQL credentials in a password manager before or right after creating the workspace.

If you're getting errors when accessing the pools or the data, re-run the final part that assigns Storage Blob Data Contributor to your Azure account.
